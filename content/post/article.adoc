= A different kind of development platform

During my day job, I work with content management systems and documentation. The main language of choice for
documentation is Asciidoc. It has a simple syntax, but enough features to keep even a hard core techie happy.
You can get up and running very quickly as the syntax is close to normal text.

This got me thinking, "Wouldn't it be handy to be able to maintain a blog purely with Asciidoc?"

Some quick Googling and chatting with colleagues and I was introduced to Hugo which is a platform which can
work with MarkDown and Asciidoc through the use of Asciidoctor to generate a web page. The platform has a rich
language for working with templates and content and could be used to build a blog with enough functionality to keep
me happy, but without the need for a database. The pages are rendered HTML so the site is blazingly fast and
very easy to maintain. It even comes with it's own server so I can test my site while I work on it.

The site it builds, doesn't run on a platform which requires a database or even the need to run a language such as PHP.
This makes it especially handy if you're working on a site relating to security where the chance of being hacked is a real concern.
There's no database, so no issues with SQL injection. It also means the website is much faster than a traditional blog platform.
As long as your site can deliver HTML, you're good to go. Combining this with a CDN and you have a very fast site.

Hugo also supports tasks which are normally driven by your blogging platform, such as RSS feed generation. Feeds can be generated
automatically when a new article is added. You can maintain articles in a "draft" state which will show up on your local machine, but
won't be published until you mark them as ready for the world. Combining this with a Git branching strategy means multiple authors can
work on articles and book them back into your main branch when ready to publish. Everyone can run a copy of the site locally
while they work on their articles.

I know I have said this before, that I want to build a blog that's simple where I can concentrate on
the content and not the mechanics but I always end up giving in and tweaking it a little bit, then a little bit more,
then a weekend is gone and I haven't written anything, just played with the theme. Hugo has a decent template system which
satisfies my need to tweak the site, but as the core articles are written in Asciidoc, there's little to play with other than
writing the article itself. Asciidoc also has great support transforming my content into other formats, such as a PDF.

This is done through "Asciidoctor" which is a digital swiss army knife for Asciidoc. Hugo uses Asciidoctor to
convert the documents while I write them so I can see a live preview. It also helps me identify places my content needs work.
Hugo runs in a console and shows me any syntax issues in my document. So I can fix them and move on. Which is different to my usual process

== Documentation workflow
I can write my first drafts in plain English, to get everything started. Once I have that down and given it a couple of passes
to make sure everything flows well, I can add asciidoc builds clean HTML. If you do the same task again and again as an
author, you can create templates in Hugo which can build a default doc each time you want to start a new article. You can also
define metadata which can later be used by your theme to help organise content. Tagging articles for example. Asciidoc also supports
the use of includes, so a standard footer with a creative commons license is easy to add with a simple addition to a template. It also helps
if you want to include a boilerplate sentence. For instance, if you want to add a paragraph which describes "how to contact support", you can
create an include for the text and then include it in any documents you want to have that section.

If you are looking for a more visual approach to working with articles, you can use the Atom editor with an asciidoc preview plugin in order
to view your document in realtime. It's support for git helps with publishing content back to github.

If you are interested in getting started with Hugo and Asciidoc, I put together a demo website with content and
they are available from the https://github.com/opensourceway/asciidoc-blog[Opensourceway Github page]. Rather than filling this article with step by step instructions
on how to download and tweak Hugo and Asciidoc, I have put notes into the website along with links to resources online to help get you started.
