= A different kind of development platform

During the day, I work with content management tools and documentation. Our preferred language of choice for
documentation is Asciidoc. It has a simple syntax, but enough features to keep even a hard core techie happy.
You can get up and running very quickly as the syntax is close to normal text.

This got me thinking, "Wouldn't it be handy to be able to maintain a blog purely with Asciidoc?"

Some quick Googling and chatting with colleagues and I was introduced to Hugo which is a platform which can
work with MarkDown and Asciidoc. The platform has a rich language for working with templates and content
and could be used to build a blog with enough functionality to keep me happy, but without the need for a database.
The pages are rendered HTML so the site is blazingly fast and very easy to maintain. It even comes with it's own
server so I can test my site while I work on it.

The site it builds, doesn't require a database or even the need to run a language such as PHP.
This makes it especially handy if you're working on a site relating to security where the chance of being hacked is a real concern.
There's no database, so no issues with SQL injection. It also means the website is much faster than a traditional blog platform.
As long as your site can deliver HTML, you're good to go. Combining this with a CDN and you have a very fast website.

Hugo also supports tasks which are normally driven by your blogging platform, such as RSS feed generation. Feeds can be generated
automatically when a new article is added. You can maintain articles in a "draft" state which will show up on your local machine, but
won't be published until you mark them as ready for the world. Combining this with a Git branching strategy means multiple authors can
work on articles and book them back into your main branch when ready to publish. Everyone can run a copy of the site locally
while they work on their articles. Other interactive elements such as comments, can be included using disqus.

Whenever I work on a blog, I always say to myself that I want to concentrate on the content more than the "container". Until I build it
and then I find myself constantly tweaking the platform. Then I tweak it a little more, then a weekend is gone and I haven't written anything!
I ended up just playing with the theme. Hugo has a decent template system which satisfies my need to tweak the site. I can also do a lot more
with a lot less code. Because the core articles are written in Asciidoc, I can focus on content rather than presentation. Asciidoc
has great support for structure documents and can transform my content into other formats, such as a PDF, HTML or a linux manpage.

This is done through "Asciidoctor" which is a digital swiss army knife for Asciidoc. Hugo uses Asciidoctor to
convert the documents while I write them so I can see a live preview. It also helps me identify places my content needs work.
Hugo runs in a console and shows me any syntax issues in my document. So I can fix them and move on. Which is different to my usual process ..

== Documentation workflow
I normally write my first drafts in plain English, to get everything started. I normally create a new branch in git for each article
which keeps things nice and simple. Once I have that down and given it a couple of passes to make sure everything flows well, I add asciidoc
markup so it can format the article as clean HTML. When the article is ready to publish, I merge it back into my master branch.

If I need to add the same text repeatedly, I use an include to contain boilerplate text. These can be setup in my template or I can add them as needed
this means I can include a standard license statement or define a different license depending on the type or article I am writing. It's also handy if
I want to insert a paragraph across different pages, for instance: a note about how to contact the author, or how to submit a support ticket.

You can also define metadata which can later be used by your theme to help organise content. Tagging articles and grouping content as an example. Handy if you
want to define a page as a "solution" or an FAQ. The template language provides a feature rich system for grouping and working with content. This is especially
handy with Asciidoc as the header of a document will have standard metadata sections which may be different between an article and a blog post. I can define them
within Hugo and it does the work for me when I create a new piece of content.

== Working with Asciidoc
My default editor of choice is Vim, which has syntax files available for Asciidoc. If you are looking for a more visual approach to working with
content, I recommend the Atom editor with an asciidoc preview plugin which makes working with Asciidoc very easy. It helps check your document as well as provide
a real-time preview of your page. As the editor was created by GitHub, it has built in support for working with Git, so working on documents across different
branches becomes straight forward.

If you are interested in getting started with Hugo and Asciidoc, I put together a demo website with content and
they are available from the https://github.com/opensourceway/asciidoc-blog[Opensourceway's Github] page. Rather than filling this article with step by step instructions
on how to download and tweak Hugo and Asciidoc, I have put notes into the website along with links to resources on-line to help get you started.
